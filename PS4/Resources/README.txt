PS4 Implementation.
Combining PS2 - Dependency Graph, PS3 - Formula Class
Dependency graph uses array of linked lists which might present an efficiency problem in the future. Might need to change but for now we'll stick with it.
Adding DLL from previous PS via resources project
DLLs added succesfully but XML files for the class libraries not found. In previous projects XML only exists for the console test programs I made to test the class.
