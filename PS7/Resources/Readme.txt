PS7 - AgCubio

11/11/2015
Program that creates a client that connects to a server to simulate a game similar to Agario.
The AgCubio model contains the cube and world classes. So far have not dealt with the world class. 
We got the client to succesfully connect to the server and to send a player name to the server. When opening the example client we were able to see 
a cube representing the player name that we created in our client.
